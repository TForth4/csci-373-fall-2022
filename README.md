### Overview

This course establishes the algorithmic foundations required to become an informed, 
well-rounded practitioner of artificial intelligence. At a high level, it 
focuses on three types of reasoning: search-based, probabilistic, and logical. 
While you likely have some experience with all three of these subjects in previous
classes, the focus of this course will be on: (a) coming to terms with the
fact that almost everything we want to do is NP-hard or worse, and
then (b) sometimes successfully doing it anyway.


### Coursework

**Homework:** There will be weekly homework assignments, typically assigned on Monday
and due the following Monday. Be advised: some homeworks are rather substantial. Doing
the homeworks is a crucial part of learning the material.

**Projects:** There will be three projects during the course. Each project is weighted
equally and addresses one module of the course. In other words, there will be one project 
about search-based reasoning, one project about probabilistic reasoning, and one project about 
logical reasoning. 

**Exams:** There will be three exams during the course. Each exam is weighted equally 
and covers one module of the course. In other words, there will be one exam about 
search-based reasoning, one exam about probabilistic reasoning, and one exam about logical
reasoning. 


### Learning Outcomes

After successful completion of the course, a student should:

1. Have facility with search-based reasoning, as demonstrated by the ability to:
  - express a novel reasoning task as a search space
  - know when and how to apply search strategies such as BFS, DFS, iterative deepening, and A*
  - know when and how to apply game search strategies such as minimax, alpha-beta, and expectimax
2. Have facility with probabilistic reasoning and reinforcement learning, as demonstrated by the ability to:
  - express a novel reasoning task as an appropriate probabilistic graphical model
  - read the structure of a Bayesian network (e.g. identify independence relationships, inferential complexity)
  - implement a temporal model to solve a real-time task
  - implement a reinforcement learner for a simple task (i.e. a task whose associated state space has <1000 states)
3. Have facility with logical reasoning, as demonstrated by the ability to:
  - translate English statements into propositional and first-order logic
  - know when and how to apply logical inference procedures, including resolution and DPLL
  - analyze the worst-case time and space requirements of inference on a logical statement
  - express logical statements in equivalent forms (e.g. CNF)
  - identify relationships between logical statements (e.g. equivalence, entailment)

### Reading Assignments

Reading assignments will be posted on the website a minimum of two days 
in advance of each lecture. I will assume that the reading is done prior 
to lecture. 


### Disability Accommodation

If you have a disability for which you are or may be requesting an
accommodation, you are encouraged to contact both your professor and the
Office of Disability Support Services.
